## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities you may discover privately, so as to not expose current users to unnecessary risk, by contacting the repository owner.

Reports will be assessed by the development team and an impact assessment carried out as soon as possible.

Further actions will be planned and communicated as deemed appropriate by the repository owner in order to minimise exposure of users to risk.
