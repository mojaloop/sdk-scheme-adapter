# Steps to run end-to-end functional tests

- Make sure you are in `test/func` directory
- Run the command `docker compose build`
- Run the command `docker compose up` (wait till all the services are up)
- Open TTK UI at [localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060) in a browser. If TTK UI does not open, give it some more time to make sure all the services are up and running.
- Go to Test Runner, Click on Collections Manager and choose `mvp-bulk.json` in `ttk-testcases` folder
- There are different test cases. If you want to run individual test case, click on Edit for that test case and click on the Send button
- If you want to run all the test cases, there is a *Run* button in Red color at the top right of the page that you can click and run all the test cases
