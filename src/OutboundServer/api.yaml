    Specification for the Mojaloop SDK Scheme Adapter Outbound Transfers API


    This API can be used by DFSP backends to simplify the process of sending funds to other parties within a Mojaloop scheme.


    Please see other documentation on https://github.com/mojaloop/sdk-scheme-adapter for more information.

        The HTTP request `POST /transfers` is used to request the movement of funds from payer DFSP to payee DFSP.

        The underlying Mojaloop API has three stages for money transfer:

          1. Party lookup. This facilitates a check by the sending party that the destination party is correct before proceeding with a money movement.
          2. Quotation. This facilitates the exchange of fee information and the construction of a cryptographic "contract" between payee and payer DFSPs before funds are transferred.
          3. Transfer. The enactment of the previously agreed "contract"

        This method has several modes of operation.

        - If the configuration variables `AUTO_ACCEPT_PARTIES` is set to `"false"` this method will terminate when the payee party has been resolved and return the payee party details.
          If the payee wishes to proceed with the transfer, then a subsequent `PUT /transfers/{transferId}` request (accepting the payee party) is required to continue the operation.
          The scheme adapter will then proceed with quotation stage...

        - If the configuration variable `AUTO_ACCEPT_QUOTES` is set to `"false"` this method will terminate and return the quotation when it has been received from the payee DFSP.
          If the payee wished to proceed with the transfer, then a subsequent `PUT /transfers/{transferId}` request (accepting the quote) is required to continue the operation.
          The scheme adapter will then proceed with the transfer state.

        If the configuration variables `AUTO_ACCEPT_PARTIES` and `AUTO_ACCEPT_QUOTES` are both set to `"true"` this method will block until all three transfer stages are complete.
        Upon completion it will return the entire set of transfer details received during the operation.


        Combinations of settings for `AUTO_ACCEPT...` configuration variables allow the scheme adapter user to decide which mode of operation best suits their use cases. i.e. the scheme
        adapter can be configured to "break" the three stage transfer at these points in order to execute backend logic such as party verification, quoted fees assessments etc...

        Below are the allowed values for the enumeration - MSISDN An MSISDN
        (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number, that is, the
        phone number) is used as reference to a participant. The MSISDN
        identifier should be in international format according to the ITU-T
        E.164 standard. Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus
        sign, indicating the international prefix. - EMAIL An email is used as
        reference to a participant. The format of the email should be according
        to the informational RFC 3696. - PERSONAL_ID A personal identifier is
        used as reference to a participant. Examples of personal identification
        are passport number, birth certificate number, and national registration
        number. The identifier number is added in the PartyIdentifier element.
        The personal identifier type is added in the PartySubIdOrType element. -
        BUSINESS A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
        is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in
        any format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or
        bill number in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
        - DEVICE A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
        specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party. For
        referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
        use the PartySubIdOrType element. - ACCOUNT_ID A bank account number or
        FSP account ID should be used as reference to a participant. The
        ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format, as formats can greatly
        differ depending on country and FSP. - IBAN A bank account number or FSP
        account ID is used as reference to a participant. The IBAN identifier
        can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric characters and should be entered
        without whitespace. - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a
        participant. The alias should be created in the FSP as an alternative
        reference to an account owner. Another example of an alias is a username
        in the FSP system. The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also
        possible to use the PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account
        under an Alias defined by the PartyIdentifier.
