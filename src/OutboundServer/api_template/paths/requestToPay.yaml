  description: >
    The HTTP request `POST /requestToPay` is used to support Pull Funds pattern
    where in a receiver can request for funds from the Sender.

    The underlying API has two stages:

      1. Party lookup. This facilitates a check by the sending party that the destination party is correct before proceeding with a money movement.
      2. Transaction Request. This request enables a Payee to request Payer to send electronic funds to the Payee.
